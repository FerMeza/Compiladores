## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to my former professor, Ulises, and my teammates, Paulina Aguilar Pérez and Bryan Áviles Martínez. This repository would not have been possible without their contributions. Additionally, I would like to point the JFlex tool for simplifying the creation of lexical analyzers in Java.
